Please note that this is my personal setup and what has worked for me, there may be updates and changes to dependencies in the future.

## Setup
- node -v
- expo init &lt;project name&gt;
- Ensure yarn.lock or package-lock.json or package.lock in C:/users/username are removed
- yarn add expo

## Dependencies
- yarn add @react-navigation/native
- yarn add react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
- yarn add @react-navigation/native-stack

## Build and Execution
